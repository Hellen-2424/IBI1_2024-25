Practical6 is SOOOOOOOOOOOO difficult!!!!!
It's tired to find the using skills of the function we need and hard to find the exact function we need unless using AI...\
Like I need to find the data type of np.where() and I need to find the usage of plt.imshow() and after this Practical the largest probability for me is to forget it...
And also, the algorithm this Practical we should use is a little bit wiser than my brain I guess... *_* 
Maybe we should be taught some algorithm in classes...
And, I would like to suggest the Pracical class be slower for the in class time is not enough for us to complete the tasks (unless we practice it before or after class like all of us do)...

But, well, whatever, this practical is such interesting for me and I like the feeling that the wisdom algorithm was filled my mind.

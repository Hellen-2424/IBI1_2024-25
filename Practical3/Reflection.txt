This practical helped me understand basic Git commands like `git init`, `git commit`, and branch management. 
I found merging branches challenging due to conflicts, but resolving them by editing files clarified how version control handles changes.
I'm still unsure about customizing Jekyll themes beyond the basic steps. 
Overall, the hands-on experience was valuable for learning version control and website deployment.
